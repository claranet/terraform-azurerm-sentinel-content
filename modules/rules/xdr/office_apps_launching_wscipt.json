        "description": "This query was originally published in the threat analytics report, Trickbot: Pervasive & underestimated.\nTrickbot is a very prevalent piece of malware with an array of malicious capabilities. Originally designed to steal banking credentials, it has since evolved into a modular trojan that can deploy other malware, disable security software, and perform command-and-control (C2) operations.\nTrickbot is frequently spread through email. An attacker will send a target a message with an attachment containing a malicious macro. If the target enables the macro, it will write a JScript Encoded (JSE) file to disk (JScript is a Microsoft dialect of ECMAScript). The JSE file will then be launched using wscript.exe to perform a variety of malicious tasks, particularly reconnaissance.\nThe following query detects when Office applications have launched wscript.exe to run a JSE file.\nSee Detect rundll.exe being used for reconnaissance and command-and-control for another query related to Trickbot activity.\nReference - https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0266/",
